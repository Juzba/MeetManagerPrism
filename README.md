I developed a notification dashboard that displays today’s events and pending invitations to the user.

The database model includes users, events, invitations, event types, and rooms, roles or recurring events.

The UI features a login screen, an overview of today’s and upcoming events, a calendar with color-coded event types, a list of user-organized events, event details with participant and invitation management, and a dialog for creating and editing events. The administration allows management of rooms and event types.

Additional features include input validation and sample data for easy application startup.
